# About
Reddit Wallpaper Changer is a lightweight C# application for Windows that will scrape Reddit for desktop wallpapers. You can specify which subs to scrape from and how oftern to rotate your wallpaper.

# Current Version - 1.0.8.1
- Only one subreddit per wallpaper search will be used (chosen at random) from the users list of Subreddits to search, improving searching relibailty/randomness and also allowing users to significently increase the list of subreddits to search for wallpapers.    
- Added additional application logging functionalty.   
- Logging is now enabled by default.
- Made the update window slightly bigger, and added scroll bar so the changes can be viewed more easily.

# Installation
RWC is a stand alone 'no installation' app. Either:

- ~~Download and run the latest MSI installer!~~  Currently withdrawn due to an installation bug.   
- Download the self extracting zip file, or download the manual zip file and extract the contents to a folder of your choice (like C:\RWC) and run!
